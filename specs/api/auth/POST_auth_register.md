# POST /api/auth/register API Specification

## Overview

This endpoint handles user registration for the DirectoryMonster platform. It should create new user accounts, validate input data, and establish the initial user state without requiring administrator privileges.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. Create a new user account with provided registration details
2. Validate all user input data for format and uniqueness
3. Support optional email verification workflow
4. Associate new users with appropriate tenant(s)
5. Assign default user role and permissions
6. Return appropriate user information without sensitive data

### Security Requirements

1. Hash passwords securely using Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) authentication
2. Generate unique user identifiers securely
3. Validate CSRF token to prevent cross-site request forgery
4. Implement rate limiting for registration attempts
5. Include anti-bot mechanisms (e.g., CAPTCHA/reCAPTCHA)
6. Log registration events for security auditing

### Performance Requirements

1. Response time should be < 500ms
2. Handle concurrent registration requests appropriately
3. Implement proper error handling with clear validation messages
4. Scale effectively under high load

## Testing Scenarios

### Success Scenarios

1. **Register new user with all fields**
   - Expected: 201 Created with user information
   - Test: Send valid registration request with all fields
   - Validation: Verify user is created in system with correct information

2. **Register with invitation token**
   - Expected: 201 Created with user in correct tenant
   - Test: Send registration with valid invitation token
   - Validation: Verify user is associated with correct tenant

3. **Register without optional fields**
   - Expected: 201 Created with user information
   - Test: Send valid registration with only required fields
   - Validation: Verify user is created with default values for optional fields

### Validation Failure Scenarios

1. **Invalid email format**
   - Expected: 400 Bad Request
   - Test: Send registration with malformed email
   - Validation: Confirm error message about invalid email format

2. **Email already registered**
   - Expected: 409 Conflict
   - Test: Try to register with email of existing user
   - Validation: Confirm error message about email already in use

3. **Username already taken**
   - Expected: 409 Conflict
   - Test: Try to register with username of existing user
   - Validation: Confirm error message about username already taken

4. **Weak password**
   - Expected: 400 Bad Request
   - Test: Send registration with simple password
   - Validation: Confirm error message about password requirements

### Security Scenarios

1. **CSRF protection**
   - Expected: 403 Forbidden
   - Test: Send request without X-CSRF-Token header
   - Validation: Confirm error message about missing CSRF token

2. **Rate limiting**
   - Expected: 429 Too Many Requests
   - Test: Submit many registration requests in a short time period
   - Validation: Confirm rate limiting kicks in and returns appropriate error

## Implementation Notes

- Implement strong validation for all user input
- Use secure methods for generating user IDs
- Consider implementing progressive registration for complex user profiles
- Test registration flow in both standalone and invitation-based contexts
- Implement clear error messages for all validation failures
- Consider supporting social login integration in future versions

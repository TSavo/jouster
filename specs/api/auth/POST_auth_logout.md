# POST /api/auth/logout API Specification

## Overview

This endpoint handles user logout, invalidating the current authentication token and terminating the user session. It should provide secure session termination while maintaining appropriate audit information.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. Invalidate the current JWT token
2. Remove any associated server-side session data
3. Provide confirmation of successful logout
4. Support both client-initiated and server-initiated logouts
5. Handle logout requests appropriately even if already logged out

### Security Requirements

1. Add token to denial list to prevent reuse
2. Clear any stored authentication cookies
3. Implement proper token revocation mechanisms
4. Log logout events for security auditing
5. Support secure logout across multiple devices (optional)

### Performance Requirements

1. Response time should be < 200ms
2. Process logout requests with high priority
3. Handle concurrent logout requests appropriately
4. Ensure logout operation completes even under server load

## API Specification

### Request

- Method: POST
- Path: /api/auth/logout
- Headers:
  - Authorization: Bearer {JWT token}
  - X-CSRF-Token: {CSRF token} (required except in test environment)
- Body: (empty or optional refresh token)
  ```json
  {
    "refreshToken": "optional-refresh-token-to-invalidate",
    "allSessions": false // Optional, logout from all sessions/devices
  }
  ```

### Response

#### Success (200 OK)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Logout successful"
}
```

#### Already Logged Out (200 OK)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Already logged out"
}
```

#### Invalid Token (401 Unauthorized)

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Invalid or expired token"
}
```

#### Server Error (500 Internal Server Error)

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Logout failed due to a server error"
}
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Success Scenarios

1. **Standard Logout**
   - Expected: 200 OK with success message
   - Test: Send valid logout request with auth token
   - Validation: Verify token is invalidated and unable to be used for subsequent requests

2. **Logout with refresh token**
   - Expected: 200 OK with success message
   - Test: Send logout request with refresh token in body
   - Validation: Verify both access and refresh tokens are invalidated

3. **Logout from all sessions**
   - Expected: 200 OK with success message
   - Test: Send logout request with allSessions=true
   - Validation: Verify all user tokens are invalidated across devices

### Edge Case Scenarios

1. **Already Logged Out**
   - Expected: 200 OK with "already logged out" message
   - Test: Send logout request with previously invalidated token
   - Validation: Verify appropriate response without error

2. **Missing Authorization Header**
   - Expected: 401 Unauthorized
   - Test: Send logout request without Authorization header
   - Validation: Verify error response for missing authentication

3. **Malformed Token**
   - Expected: 401 Unauthorized
   - Test: Send logout with malformed JWT token
   - Validation: Verify appropriate error response

### Security Scenarios

1. **CSRF Protection**
   - Expected: 403 Forbidden when missing CSRF token
   - Test: Send request without X-CSRF-Token header
   - Validation: Confirm appropriate error response

2. **Token Denial List**
   - Expected: Invalidated token cannot be used
   - Test: Logout, then attempt to use same token
   - Validation: Verify subsequent requests fail authentication

3. **Session Cookie Clearing**
   - Expected: Auth cookies are cleared
   - Test: Logout and inspect cookie store
   - Validation: Verify auth-related cookies are removed or invalidated

## Implementation Notes

- Implement token denial list with appropriate TTL matching token expiration
- Consider using Redis or similar for distributed token denial list
- Add clear audit logging for security analysis
- Consider implementing notification to other sessions on forced logout
- Test logout flows across multiple devices and browsers
- Consider implementing single logout for SSO integrations

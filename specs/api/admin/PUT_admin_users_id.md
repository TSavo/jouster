# PUT /api/admin/users/:id API Specification

## Overview

This endpoint updates an existing user in the system. It allows administrators to modify user profiles, change roles and permissions, update tenant/site access, and manage user account status. The endpoint supports partial updates and handles validation of all modified fields.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. Update user profile information (name, email, etc.)
2. Modify user roles and permissions
3. Update tenant and site assignments
4. Change user status (active, suspended, locked)
5. Update authentication settings and methods
6. Support password resets and MFA configuration
7. Allow metadata updates

### Security Requirements

1. Require authentication with valid admin JWT token
2. Verify user has 'user:update' permission
3. Enforce tenant isolation (admins can only update users in their tenant)
4. Super admins can update users across tenants
5. Sanitize and validate all input data
6. Prevent privilege escalation attacks
7. Log all user updates for audit purposes
8. Implement proper validation for sensitive operations

### Performance Requirements

1. Response time should be < 500ms for typical updates
2. Efficiently handle concurrent update requests
3. Implement optimistic locking or versioning for race conditions
4. Cache invalidation for updated user data

## Implementation Notes

- Implement comprehensive input validation for all updated fields
- Check email uniqueness before applying update
- Use proper password hashing for any password updates
- Implement change tracking for auditing purposes
- Send verification emails for sensitive changes (e.g., email updates)
- Consider sending notifications for significant changes (status, role)
- Implement proper database transactions for complex updates
- Consider optimistic locking to prevent update conflicts
- Validate all role changes against admin's own permissions
- Apply tenant isolation at database query level
- Implement special handling for self-updates by admins
- Consider field-level permission checking for fine-grained control
- Cache invalidation for updated user data

## Testing Scenarios

### Success Scenarios

1. **Retrieve submission details**
   - Expected: 200 OK with detailed submission information
   - Test: Send request with valid admin JWT, tenant ID, and submission ID

2. **Retrieve submission with multiple revisions**
   - Expected: 200 OK with revision history
   - Test: Create submission with multiple updates, verify revision history is complete

3. **Retrieve submission with feedback**
   - Expected: 200 OK with feedback history
   - Test: Add admin feedback to submission, verify feedback is included in response

### Authentication and Authorization Scenarios

   - Test: Send request without authentication token, verify 401 response

2. **Non-admin user**
   - Expected: 403 Forbidden
   - Test: Send request with non-admin JWT, verify 403 response

3. **Admin from different tenant**
   - Expected: 404 Not Found or 403 Forbidden
   - Test: Send request with admin JWT but for different tenant, verify proper tenant isolation

### Edge Case Scenarios

## Implementation Notes

- Implement proper tenant isolation using the tenant context header
- Use Redis for caching frequently accessed submissions
- Store revision history efficiently to track changes over time
- Implement similarity detection to identify potential duplicate listings
- Add appropriate logging for security and audit purposes
- Consider implementing automated quality checks for submissions
- Optimize database queries for performance
- Implement proper error handling with meaningful messages
- Consider adding AI-assisted review suggestions for administrators

## Relationship to Approval Process

This endpoint provides the detailed information administrators need to make informed decisions about submissions:

1. Administrators can review all submission details
2. Revision history shows how the submission has evolved
3. Feedback history shows communication with the submitter
4. Automated checks provide initial quality assessment
5. Similar listing detection helps prevent duplicates

This detailed view is essential for maintaining quality control and ensuring that only appropriate content is published to the directory.

## Implementation Notes

- Implement proper tenant isolation using the tenant context header
- Store assignment history to track all assignments
- Implement notification system for assignee alerts
- Add appropriate logging for security and audit purposes
- Consider implementing workload balancing for automatic assignments
- Track assignment patterns and completion rates for performance metrics
- Implement proper error handling with meaningful messages
- Consider adding automated follow-up reminders for approaching deadlines
- Ensure assignees have appropriate permissions to review submissions

## Priority Levels

Standard priority levels for submission review:

1. **low**: Non-urgent submissions, longer review timeframe acceptable
2. **medium**: Standard submissions, normal review timeframe
3. **high**: Important submissions requiring prompt review
4. **urgent**: Critical submissions requiring immediate attention

## Relationship to Review Workflow

This endpoint facilitates team-based review processes:

1. Submissions enter the system and await assignment
2. Administrators assign submissions to appropriate team members
3. Assigned administrators review and process their submissions
4. Assignment tracking provides accountability and workload visibility

This assignment system improves review efficiency by:
- Distributing workload across the team
- Matching submissions to administrators with relevant expertise
- Providing clear ownership of each submission
- Enabling prioritization of important submissions
- Tracking review deadlines and performance metrics

The assignment process is particularly valuable for organizations with specialized review teams or high submission volumes.

## Implementation Notes

- Implement proper tenant isolation using the tenant context header
- Use Redis transactions for atomicity when creating the listing
- Update search indexes to include the new listing
- Implement notification system for submitter feedback
- Add appropriate logging for security and audit purposes
- Consider implementing approval workflows for multi-step approval processes
- Store approval history for audit trail
- Implement proper error handling with meaningful messages
- Consider adding automated post-approval checks

## Relationship to Submission Workflow

This endpoint is the critical bridge between the submission process and published content:

1. Users submit content through the Submission API
2. Administrators review submissions through the Admin API
3. This endpoint converts approved submissions into published listings
4. Published listings become visible through the Public API

The approval process ensures quality control while providing a path for user-contributed content to enter the directory. This maintains the integrity of the directory while enabling community participation.

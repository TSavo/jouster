# GET /api/admin/audit API Specification

## Overview

This endpoint retrieves a paginated and filterable list of audit events from the system. It enables administrators to review system activities, troubleshoot issues, and maintain compliance with security policies by tracking user actions and system events.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. Return a paginated list of audit events based on filter criteria
2. Support filtering by event type, user, resource, date range, and success status
3. Support sorting by timestamp (ascending/descending)
4. Include detailed information about each event
5. Support exporting of filtered results in various formats

### Security Requirements

1. Require authentication with valid admin JWT token
2. Verify user has 'audit:read' permission
3. Enforce tenant isolation (administrators can only see events within their tenant scope)
4. Super admins can see events across all tenants
5. Redact sensitive information based on user permissions
6. Log access to audit logs themselves

### Performance Requirements

1. Response time should be < 1000ms for typical requests
2. Efficiently handle large audit datasets with proper pagination
3. Optimize query performance for common filtering patterns
4. Support progressive loading for large result sets

## Implementation Notes

- Use a time-series database or specialized logging system for efficient audit logs storage
- Implement proper indexing for common query patterns
- Consider partitioning audit data by date for better performance
- Implement retention policies to manage growth of audit logs
- Use Redis for caching frequent audit queries
- Implement proper tenant isolation through data partitioning
- Add appropriate compression for audit log storage
- Consider using async processing for recording audit events
- Implement progressive loading for large result sets
- Ensure sensitive data is properly redacted in audit logs
- Log access to audit logs themselves for meta-auditing

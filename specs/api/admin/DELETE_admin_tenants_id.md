## Testing Scenarios

### Success Scenarios

1. **Archive small tenant**
   - Expected: 200 OK with immediate deletion confirmation
   - Test: Send deletion request with permanent=false for small tenant, verify immediate completion

2. **Permanently delete tenant**
   - Expected: 200 OK with deletion job details
   - Test: Send deletion request with permanent=true, verify deletion job initiated

3. **Delete with data export**
   - Expected: 200 OK with export job details
   - Test: Send deletion request with exportData=true, verify export initiated

4. **Delete with owner notification**
   - Expected: 200 OK and notification sent
   - Test: Send deletion with notifyOwner=true, verify notification sent

### Validation Failure Scenarios

1. **Missing confirmation code**
   - Expected: 400 Bad Request
   - Test: Send deletion request without confirmation code, verify validation error

2. **Incorrect confirmation code**
   - Expected: 400 Bad Request
   - Test: Send deletion with incorrect confirmation code, verify validation error

### Authentication and Authorization Scenarios

1. **Missing authentication**
   - Expected: 401 Unauthorized
   - Test: Send request without authentication token, verify 401 response

2. **Non-super-admin user**
   - Expected: 403 Forbidden
   - Test: Send request with regular admin JWT, verify 403 response

### Edge Case Scenarios

1. **Tenant not found**
   - Expected: 404 Not Found
   - Test: Attempt to delete non-existent tenant ID, verify 404 response

2. **Deletion already in progress**
   - Expected: 409 Conflict
   - Test: Attempt to delete tenant with deletion already in progress, verify conflict response

3. **Very large tenant**
   - Expected: 200 OK with long-running job
   - Test: Delete large tenant with many resources, verify asynchronous processing

## Implementation Notes

- Implement proper permission checks for super-admin access
- Use background jobs for handling deletion of large tenants
- Implement data export functionality for compliance purposes
- Add appropriate logging for security and audit purposes
- Consider implementing a tenant recovery process for accidental deletions
- Ensure complete cleanup of all tenant resources:
  - Redis keys
  - Database records
  - Storage files
  - User accounts
  - Subscription data
- Implement proper notification to tenant owner and users
- Consider legal and compliance requirements for data retention
- Implement progress tracking for long-running deletion jobs
- Ensure proper error handling and recovery for failed deletions

## Deletion Process

The tenant deletion process involves several stages:

1. **Validation**: Verify deletion request and confirmation
2. **Preparation**: Prepare for deletion and initiate data export if requested
3. **Notification**: Notify tenant owner and users of impending deletion
4. **Resource Cleanup**:
   - Revoke user access
   - Remove tenant data from database
   - Delete tenant files from storage
   - Clean up Redis keys
   - Cancel subscriptions and billing
5. **Finalization**: Complete deletion and generate audit records

For non-permanent deletions (archiving), the tenant data is marked as deleted but retained for the specified retention period before permanent removal.

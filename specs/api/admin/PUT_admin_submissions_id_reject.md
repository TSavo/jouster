## Testing Scenarios

### Success Scenarios

1. **Reject submission with reason**

   - Test: Send rejection request with reason, verify submission status updated to rejected

2. **Reject with detailed feedback**
   - Expected: 200 OK and feedback stored
   - Test: Send rejection with detailed feedback, verify feedback is stored with submission

3. **Reject with notification**

   - Test: Send rejection with notifySubmitter=true, verify notification sent

4. **Reject but allow resubmission**
   - Expected: 200 OK with allowResubmission=true
   - Test: Send rejection with allowResubmission=true, verify flag is set correctly

### Authentication and Authorization Scenarios

## Implementation Notes

- Implement proper tenant isolation using the tenant context header
- Use standardized rejection reason categories for analytics
- Implement notification system for submitter feedback
- Add appropriate logging for security and audit purposes
- Store rejection history for audit trail
- Consider implementing rejection templates for common scenarios
- Track rejection patterns to identify potential issues with submission guidelines
- Implement proper error handling with meaningful messages
- Consider adding automated suggestions for improvement

## Rejection Reason Categories

Standardized rejection categories help with analytics and reporting:

1. **content_quality**: Submission lacks detail or has poor quality content
2. **inappropriate_content**: Submission contains prohibited or inappropriate content
3. **duplicate_listing**: Submission duplicates an existing listing
4. **incorrect_category**: Submission is in the wrong category
5. **broken_url**: The submitted URL is broken or inaccessible
6. **spam**: Submission appears to be spam or promotional without value
7. **policy_violation**: Submission violates platform policies
8. **insufficient_information**: Submission lacks required information
9. **other**: Other reason (requires details)

## Relationship to Submission Workflow

This endpoint is an essential part of the content moderation process:

1. Users submit content through the Submission API
2. Administrators review submissions through the Admin API
3. This endpoint allows rejection of submissions that don't meet standards
4. Rejected submissions can be improved and resubmitted if allowed

The rejection process maintains quality control while providing feedback to submitters on how to improve their contributions. This helps maintain the integrity of the directory while educating contributors about content standards.

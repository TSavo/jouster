# PUT /api/admin/submissions/{submissionId}/feedback API Specification

## Overview

5. Notify the submitter of the feedback (if configured)
6. Support changing submission status to "changes_requested"
7. Support setting a feedback response deadline

### Security Requirements

1. Require authentication with admin privileges
2. Validate tenant context for proper isolation
3. Enforce permission checks for submission feedback
4. Log feedback action for audit purposes
5. Prevent cross-tenant access to submissions

### Performance Requirements

1. Response time should be < 300ms
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Handle the transaction atomically

## Testing Scenarios

### Success Scenarios

1. **Provide feedback without changing status**
   - Expected: 200 OK with feedback stored
   - Test: Send feedback request with changeStatus=false, verify feedback stored but status unchanged

2. **Provide feedback and change status**
   - Expected: 200 OK with status changed to changes_requested
   - Test: Send feedback with changeStatus=true, verify status updated

3. **Provide feedback with notification**
   - Expected: 200 OK and notification sent
   - Test: Send feedback with notifySubmitter=true, verify notification sent

4. **Provide feedback with response deadline**
   - Expected: 200 OK with deadline set
   - Test: Send feedback with responseDeadline, verify deadline is set correctly

### Authentication and Authorization Scenarios

1. **Missing authentication**
   - Expected: 401 Unauthorized
   - Test: Send request without authentication token, verify 401 response

2. **Non-admin user**

2. **Empty feedback message**
   - Expected: 400 Bad Request
   - Test: Send request with empty feedback message, verify validation error

3. **Invalid response deadline**
   - Expected: 400 Bad Request
   - Test: Send request with past date as response deadline, verify validation error

## Implementation Notes

- Implement proper tenant isolation using the tenant context header
- Store feedback history to track all communication
- Implement notification system for submitter feedback
- Add appropriate logging for security and audit purposes
- Consider implementing feedback templates for common scenarios
- Track feedback patterns to identify common issues with submissions
- Implement proper error handling with meaningful messages
- Consider adding automated follow-up reminders for unresolved feedback
- Implement a system for submitters to respond to feedback

## Relationship to Submission Workflow

This endpoint enables an iterative improvement process for submissions:

1. Users submit content through the Submission API
2. Administrators review submissions and provide feedback using this endpoint
3. Users update their submissions based on feedback
4. Administrators can then approve or reject the improved submission

This feedback loop improves content quality while maintaining a collaborative relationship with submitters. It allows for refinement of submissions before final approval or rejection, leading to higher quality published content.

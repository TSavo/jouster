# GET /api/admin/listings API Specification

## Overview

This endpoint retrieves a paginated list of listings across all sites within the tenant context of the authenticated administrator. It provides comprehensive filtering, sorting, and search capabilities to facilitate efficient listing management in the admin interface.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

4. Include detailed listing information in the response
5. Support searching across multiple listing fields
6. Include category and site information for each listing

### Security Requirements

## Testing Scenarios

### Success Scenarios

1. **Retrieve default listings (first page)**
   - Expected: 200 OK with first page of listings (20 items)
   - Test: Send request with valid JWT for admin
   - Validation: Verify response contains listings array and pagination data

2. **Pagination works correctly**
   - Expected: 200 OK with specified page of listings
   - Test: Send request with page=2&limit=10
   - Validation: Verify response contains correct page and limit in pagination

3. **Filter by site**

   - Test: Send request with siteId parameter
   - Validation: Verify all listings in response belong to specified site

4. **Filter by status**
   - Expected: 200 OK with filtered list
   - Test: Send request with status=published
   - Validation: Verify all listings have published status

5. **Filter by featured status**
   - Expected: 200 OK with filtered list
   - Test: Send request with featured=true
   - Validation: Verify all listings are featured

6. **Filter by verification status**
   - Expected: 200 OK with filtered list
   - Test: Send request with verified=true
   - Validation: Verify all listings have been verified

## Implementation Notes

- Implement efficient filter chain processing for multiple filter combinations
- Use Redis for caching common listing queries with appropriate invalidation
- Implement proper indexing for fields commonly used in filtering
- Apply tenant-specific key prefixing for proper isolation
- Use database joins efficiently to reduce query count
- Implement proper search indexing for text search capabilities
- Consider implementing faceted search for advanced filtering
- Add proper logging for audit purposes and performance monitoring
- Ensure custom fields are handled efficiently in search and filter operations
- Support incremental loading patterns for frontend interfaces

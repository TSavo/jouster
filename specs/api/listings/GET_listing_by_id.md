## Testing Scenarios

### Success Scenarios

1. **Retrieve existing listing by ID**
   - Expected: 200 OK with listing object
   - Test: Create site, category, and listing; send GET request by ID
   - Validation: Verify all listing fields, category info, and URL are correct

2. **Listing with missing category**
   - Expected: 200 OK with null category
   - Test: Create listing with categoryId that doesn't exist
   - Validation: Verify response has null for category and url fields

3. **URL generation with domain**
   - Expected: URL generated with proper domain
   - Test: Create site with domain, add listing, retrieve listing
   - Validation: Verify URL uses site domain in proper format

4. **URL generation without domain (localhost)**
   - Expected: URL generated with localhost
   - Test: Create site without domain, add listing, retrieve listing
   - Validation: Verify URL uses localhost in proper format

### Error Scenarios

1. **Site not found**
   - Expected: 404 Not Found
   - Test: Send request for non-existent site slug
   - Validation: Confirm error message is "Site not found"

2. **Listing not found**
   - Expected: 404 Not Found
   - Test: Send request for non-existent listing ID
   - Validation: Confirm error message is "Listing not found"

3. **Listing exists but belongs to different site**
   - Expected: 404 Not Found
   - Test: Create listing in site1, attempt to access it through site2's endpoint
   - Validation: Confirm error message is "Listing not found in this site"

### Data Integrity Scenarios

1. **Handle Redis connection issues**
   - Expected: 500 Internal Server Error
   - Test: Simulate Redis connection failure
   - Validation: Confirm error message is "Failed to fetch listing"

2. **Handle corrupted listing or category data**
   - Expected: Graceful error handling
   - Test: Seed Redis with corrupt listing or category data
   - Validation: Verify appropriate error responses

## Implementation Notes

- Use Jest and Supertest for API endpoint testing
- Create mocks for Redis client to simulate different data scenarios
- Implement helper functions to create test fixtures for sites, categories, and listings
- Test URL generation with both domain and localhost scenarios
- Verify Redis key patterns match between test and implementation
- Create specific test cases for tenant isolation
- Test category lookup failures

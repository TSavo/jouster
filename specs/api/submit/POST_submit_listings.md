5. Return submission ID and status information
6. Support optional notification preferences

### Security Requirements

1. Require authentication (JWT token)
2. Validate user has basic submission permissions
3. Implement rate limiting to prevent submission spam
4. Sanitize all user input to prevent injection attacks
5. Store submission in tenant-specific context
6. Log submission activity for audit purposes

### Performance Requirements

1. Response time should be < 500ms
2. Handle file uploads efficiently (if applicable)

## Testing Scenarios

### Success Scenarios

1. **Submit valid listing**
   - Expected: 201 Created with submission details
   - Test: Send valid submission data, verify response contains submission ID and pending status

2. **Submit with optional fields**
   - Expected: 201 Created with submission details
   - Test: Send submission with optional fields omitted, verify submission is created with default values

### Validation Failure Scenarios

1. **Missing required fields**
   - Expected: 400 Bad Request
   - Test: Send submissions missing required fields, verify appropriate validation errors

2. **Invalid data formats**
   - Expected: 400 Bad Request
   - Test: Send submissions with invalid URLs, emails, etc., verify validation errors

3. **Category doesn't exist**
   - Expected: 400 Bad Request
   - Test: Submit to non-existent category, verify appropriate error

### Authentication Scenarios

1. **Missing authentication**
   - Expected: 401 Unauthorized
   - Test: Send request without authentication token, verify 401 response

2. **Invalid authentication**
   - Expected: 401 Unauthorized
   - Test: Send request with invalid token, verify 401 response

### Rate Limiting Scenarios

1. **Exceed submission limit**
   - Expected: 429 Too Many Requests
   - Test: Submit multiple listings in quick succession, verify rate limit response

### Edge Case Scenarios

1. **Very large submission**
   - Expected: Proper handling of large text fields
   - Test: Submit listing with maximum allowed field lengths, verify proper handling

2. **Duplicate submission**
   - Expected: Appropriate handling (accept as new or reject as duplicate)
   - Test: Submit identical listing twice, verify system behavior matches requirements

## Implementation Notes

- Store submissions separately from approved listings
- Implement workflow status tracking (pending, approved, rejected)
- Send notifications to administrators about new submissions
- Consider implementing spam detection for submissions
- Provide clear feedback to users about submission status
- Implement proper tenant isolation for submissions
- Consider adding support for draft submissions that users can complete later
- Add appropriate logging for security and audit purposes

## Relationship to Admin API

The submission API works in conjunction with the admin API:

1. Users submit content through the submission API
2. Admins review submissions through the admin API
3. Admins can approve, reject, or request changes to submissions
4. Approved submissions are published to the public API

This separation provides a clear workflow for content contribution while maintaining quality control and security.

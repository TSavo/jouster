## Testing Scenarios

### Success Scenarios

1. **Retrieve all user submissions**
   - Expected: 200 OK with array of submissions
   - Test: Send request with valid JWT, verify response contains user's submissions

2. **Filter by status**
   - Expected: 200 OK with filtered submissions
   - Test: Send request with status=pending, verify only pending submissions returned

3. **Filter by site and category**
   - Expected: 200 OK with filtered submissions
   - Test: Send request with siteSlug and categorySlug filters, verify filtered results

4. **Pagination works correctly**
   - Expected: 200 OK with paginated results
   - Test: Create multiple submissions, request with page=2&limit=5, verify correct page returned

### Authentication Scenarios

1. **Missing authentication**
   - Expected: 401 Unauthorized
   - Test: Send request without authentication token, verify 401 response

2. **Invalid authentication**
   - Expected: 401 Unauthorized
   - Test: Send request with invalid token, verify 401 response

### Edge Case Scenarios

1. **No submissions match filters**
   - Expected: 200 OK with empty submissions array
   - Test: Filter by non-matching criteria, verify empty array response

2. **Invalid filter parameters**
   - Expected: 400 Bad Request
   - Test: Send request with invalid filter values, verify appropriate error response

## Implementation Notes

- Ensure users can only see their own submissions
- Include detailed status information to help users understand where their submission is in the workflow
- Consider implementing webhook notifications for status changes
- Store admin feedback securely and associate it with the submission
- Implement proper tenant isolation for submissions
- Consider adding support for submission statistics (approval rate, average review time, etc.)
- Add appropriate logging for security and audit purposes

## Relationship to Admin API

While this endpoint allows users to view their own submissions, the admin API provides more comprehensive submission management:

1. Users view their submissions through this endpoint
2. Admins review all submissions through the admin API
3. Admins can provide feedback that users see in their submission details
4. Status changes made by admins are reflected in the user's submission view

This separation ensures users have visibility into their contributions while maintaining administrative control over the approval process.

## Implementation Notes

- Ensure users can only withdraw their own submissions
- Implement soft deletion by default (mark as withdrawn but keep record)
- Consider implementing a recovery period during which withdrawn submissions can be restored
- Add appropriate logging for security and audit purposes
- Consider implementing a notification system to alert admins about withdrawn submissions
- Store withdrawal reason for analytics purposes
- Track withdrawal patterns to identify potential issues with the submission process

## Relationship to Admin API

This endpoint works in conjunction with the admin review process:

1. Users can withdraw submissions they no longer wish to have published
2. Admins can see withdrawn submissions (marked as such) through the admin API
3. Withdrawal statistics can help identify potential issues with the submission process
4. Permanent deletion requests may require additional verification

This allows users to maintain control over their submissions while providing administrators with a complete audit trail of submission activity.

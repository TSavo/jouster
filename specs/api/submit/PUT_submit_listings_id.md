## Implementation Notes

- Ensure users can only update their own submissions
- Implement proper validation for all fields
- Consider implementing a change tracking system to highlight what was changed
- Reset review status if significant fields are changed (title, description, URL)
- Consider adding a "revision count" to track how many times a submission has been updated
- Add appropriate logging for security and audit purposes
- Consider implementing a notification system to alert admins about updated submissions
- Store previous versions for audit purposes

## Relationship to Admin API

This endpoint works in conjunction with the admin review process:

1. Users can update their submissions while they are still pending
2. Admins can see the update history through the admin API
3. Significant updates may reset the review status or trigger re-review
4. Admins can provide feedback requesting specific updates

This allows for an iterative submission improvement process while maintaining administrative control over the final approval.

# Documentation Archive

This directory contains outdated documentation that has been superseded by newer documents. These files are maintained for historical reference but should not be used for current development work.

## Purpose

This archive exists to:
- Track the evolution of documentation
- Provide context for older implementation decisions
- Serve as a reference for understanding previous approaches

## Usage Guidelines

- Do not use these documents for current implementation work
- Always refer to the current documentation in the main `/docs` directory
- If information from these documents is still relevant, it should be migrated to current documentation
